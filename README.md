### C#-Intro 

Some notes and thoughts while learning C# <br>


 Create a new C# app

`dotnet new` creates a new app <br>
`console` is the type of app to create <br>
`-o myApp` sets an output directory

```shell
dotnet new console -o myApp
cd myApp
```

Create an overload method: <br>
- You create two or more methods with the same name, but with different number of input parameter and / or different data types

why choose a `do...while` statement <br>
- When you need to execute the block of code at least once. 
- `while` helps with continue iterating through a block of code until a given condition is no longer true
